Remove console log
Made the method asynchronous
module.exports = function(app){
    app.post('/api/usages', async (req, res, next) => {

        try {
            // Store the supplied usage data
            await app.usages.push(req.body);

            var usageId = await app.usages.length;
            // console.log('Stored usage count: ' + usageId);
            res.status(201).json({'id':usageId});
        } catch(e) {
            next(e)
        }
    });
}
Made a Postman collection to easily exercise the Postman
Built a C# console app to make an number of simultaneous calls
Tried pulling out the push and that doesn't seem to be the bottleneck.
Generated a PowerShell script to invoke the request
